# MyMusicStore-Bootstrap-Website---Muzik-Dukkanim-
A multiple paged website I designed using Bootstrap. This was also a homework project for the website Patika.dev.

# During The Project
Within this project I learned the basic logic fo rows, columns and containers. It took some time for me the grasp the concept of multiple cards and rows but a thorough examination of the Bootstrap documentation allowed me to find the solution I was looknig for. I also realized how easy it is to create websites using Bootstrap rather than using just basic HTML / CSS
